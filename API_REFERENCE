Because of how Mylar is based upon headphones, logistically the API that rembo10 has created for headphones
will work reasonably well for Mylar - with some obvious changes. With that said, this was all taken from headphones
as a starting base and will be added to as required.
The API is really new and probably needs alot of cleaning up and to be tested out properly.
There are no error codes yet, but will be added soon.
